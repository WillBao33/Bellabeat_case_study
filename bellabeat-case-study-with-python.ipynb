The company leverages Sršen's artistic background to design aesthetically pleasing technology that tracks activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health, empowering women with valuable health insights.\n## About the case study\nThe data analyst is asked to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. Based on the analysis of the usage data, the data analyst is asked to select one Bellabeat product to apply the discovered insights in the presentation.\n## 1. Phase 1: Ask\n### 1.1 **Business Task** \nAnalyze the usage data of non-Bellabeat smart devices to identify consumer behaviour patterns and preferences. The insights gained from this analysis will be used to recommend improvements or new features to one of Bellabeat’s products, enhancing its appeal and usability based on real-world consumer data.\n### 1.2 **Key Stakeholders**\n* Urška Sršen - Bellabeat cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* Sando Mur - Bellabeat cofounder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n* Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team\n\n## 2. Phase 2: Prepare\n### 2.1 Dataset Source\nFitBit Fitness Tracker Data, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain)\n### 2.2 Dataset Information\nThis dataset was generated from a distributed survey conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3, 2016, and December 5, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to submit their personal tracker data, which includes minute-level details on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The data can be segmented by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Differences in the data reflect the use of various Fitbit tracker models and individual tracking habits/preferences.\n### 2.3 Dataset Organization\nThe dataset consists of 18 CSV files, containing information on activity, calories, intensities, and steps, categorized into daily, hourly, and minute intervals. It also includes data on heart rate, metabolic equivalents (METs), sleep duration, and weight. The dataset is organized in a long table format, where each user is assigned a unique ID, and each row represents an individual observation for a specific user. Consequently, each user ID appears multiple times across rows, as the data is tracked by day and time.\n### 2.4 Dataset Credibility and Integrity\nThe dataset is relatively small, containing only 30 users and lacking demographic information such as location, age, and health condition, which could introduce sampling bias. Additionally, some data categories, like weight, have only 8 user submissions, making it difficult to analyze alongside data categories like activity, calories, and intensities, which have 33 user submissions. Furthermore, the dataset was last updated four months ago, so it cannot be considered current. Consequently, the analytical results of this case study may not accurately reflect the current insights of the smart device market.\n\n## 3. Phase 3: Process\nIn this case study, I aim to investigate the dataset to uncover insights on the following questions:\n* Does daily activity impact users' sleep duration?\n* During which time period does most daily activity occur?\n\nThe following dataset will be used for this case study:\n* dailyActivity_merged.csv\n* sleepDay_merged.csv\n* hourlyIntensities_merged.csv\n\nThis notebook is prepared in Python programming language.

Phase 5: Share\nBy analyzing the smart device usage data, I would like to share the following results and insights with stakeholders:\n1. Correlation Analysis Between Total Steps/Burned Calories and Sleep Time:\n* The analysis revealed that daily activity has little to no correlation with users' sleep duration. This is likely because most activities or steps were of low intensity, which did not exhaust users significantly. Additionally, some users may adhere to a fixed sleeping schedule that is unaffected by their daily intensity levels.\n2. Correlation Analysis Between Total Steps and Burned Calories:\n* A moderate positive correlation was found between total steps and calories burned, indicating that the number of daily steps taken does impact the total daily calories burned. However, the correlation is not strong, possibly because many steps were of low intensity, such as casual walking, rather than higher intensity activities like inclined walking or running, which burn calories more efficiently.\n* For Bellabeat smart device users who aim to lose weight, I suggest that the Bellabeat app include features that track daily activities, such as steps and workouts, allow users to set daily activity or calorie-burning goals, and create reminders to encourage users to achieve their daily goals. On days with high activity levels, the Bellabeat app should also remind users to sleep early to better prepare for the following day.\n3. Analysis of Mean Total Intensity by Hour:\n* The analysis shows that most activities occur during standard lunch breaks (12 to 2 PM) and after work hours (5 to 7 PM).\n* Based on this analysis, I recommend that Bellabeat remind users to take breaks for walking or exercise after long periods of working to refresh the body and mind. Additionally, a short walk after meals is suggested to aid digestion and increase circulation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 6. Phase 6: Act\n### 6.1 Final Conclusion:\nBased on our analysis of smart device usage data, we have identified key insights into the correlation between daily activities and sleep duration, the impact of daily steps on calories burned, and the peak times for user activities. Specifically, we found that:\n\n1. Daily activities, such as total steps and burned calories, show little to no correlation with sleep duration.\n2. There is a moderate positive correlation between total steps and calories burned.\n3. The peak times for user activities are during lunch breaks (12 to 2 PM) and after work hours (5 to 7 PM).\n\n### 6.2 Applying Insights:\nOur team and business can leverage these insights to enhance the Bellabeat app and better support our users' health and wellness goals. Specifically:\n1. **Sleep and Activity Correlation**:\n    * **App Feature**: Introduce features that allow users to track both their daily activities and sleep patterns, helping them understand their behavior better.\n    * **User Education**: Educate users about the importance of sleep hygiene and suggest maintaining a consistent sleep schedule irrespective of daily activity levels.\n\n2. **Daily Steps and Calories Burned**:\n    * **Activity Tracking**: Implement a robust activity tracking system that records both the number and intensity of steps.\n    * **Goal Setting**: Allow users to set daily activity and calorie-burning goals, and provide real-time feedback and reminders to encourage goal completion.\n    * **Weight Management**: For users aiming to lose weight, offer tailored recommendations for incorporating higher intensity activities that burn calories more efficiently.\n    \n3. **Peak Activity Times**:\n    * **Break Reminders**: Send reminders during typical break periods (12 to 2 PM and 5 to 7 PM) to encourage physical activity, whether it’s a short walk or a workout.\n    * **Post-Meal Activities**: Promote short walks after meals to aid digestion and improve circulation.\n    \n### 6.3 Next Steps:\n1. **Feature Development**: Begin developing the new app features as outlined above, focusing on activity tracking, goal setting, and reminders.\n2. **User Testing**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on these new features and ensure they are user-friendly and effective.\n3. **Marketing**: Create a marketing campaign to highlight these new features and their benefits to users.\n\n### 6.4 Additional Data for Expansion:\n1. **Demographic Data**: Collect demographic information (age, gender, occupation) to understand how different user groups interact with the app and their specific needs.\n2. **Activity Types**: Gather more detailed data on the types of activities users engage in, such as walking, running, or cycling, to provide more personalized recommendations.\n3. **Lifestyle Data**: Include data on users' lifestyle factors, such as diet and stress levels, to offer holistic wellness advice.\n\nBy implementing these steps, we can enhance the Bellabeat app, providing more value to our users and promoting healthier lifestyles.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
